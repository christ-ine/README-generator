    ## Table of Contents (Optional)
    
    If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
    
    * [Installation](#installation)
    * [Usage](#usage)
    * [Credits](#credits)
    * [License](#license)
    
    
    ## Installation
    
    ${answers.installation}
    
    
    ## Usage 
    
    ${answers.usage}
    
    
    ## Credits
    
    List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
    
    If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
    
    If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
    
    
    
    ## License
    
    The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

    üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
    
    ## Badges

    Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
