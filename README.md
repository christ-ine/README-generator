# README Generator

## Description
    
    Every project needs a README, but oftentimes READMEs are an afterthought in a developer's mind. It sometimes becomes tedious formatting a README for every repository. This application seeks to eliminate tedious portion of creating a README and allows a user to focus on the important content. It prompts you using questions and the user's answers are used to generate a README file that the user can add to the project of their choosing. Users no longer have to worry about missing a crucial section of their README.
